	<p>
		Creating Postico wouldn't have been possible without all the wonderful software it builds upon.
		I'd like to thank the authors of all the open source projects below.
	</p>
	<h2><a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a></h2>
	<p>
		Most important, I'd like to thank the PostgreSQL project for making an awesome database.
		I'm grateful for their permissive license that allows me to use <i>libpq</i>, the PostgreSQL client library.

	<p>
	LibSSH2 is a pretty awesome library. It implements an SSH client,
	and allows Postico to connect using SSH tunnels.
	I'd especially like to point out the great documentation, and the well written C code.
	It's a pleasure to work with code like this!

		I'd also like to thank the OpenSSL project.
		Their implementation of the SSL protocol is used by PostgreSQL for secure connections,

  ==============

  The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of
  the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
  See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
  Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
  please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.

<h2><a href="">Aquatic Prime</a></h2>

<p>
	The version of Postico distributed on my website uses Aquatic Prime for licensing.
	The best thing about Aquatic Prime is that it's completely integrated into Fastspring, 
	so it took me very little time to write the licensing code,
	leaving me more time for working on the stuff that makes Postico great.
